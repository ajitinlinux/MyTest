Heap is a tree based data structure in which all the nodes in a tree are in a specific order.

The maximum number of children in a heap depends upon the type of the heap.
In more commonly used heap type there are at most two children of a node and
it is known as a binary heap.

In binary heap, if heap is the complete binary tree with N nodes, then it has
smallest possible height which is log2N.

There are two types of heap MaxHeap and MinHeap
1> MaxHeap : In this type of heap value of parent node will always be greater than
  or equal to the value of child node across the tree and node with the highest value
  will be the root node of the tree.

2> MinHeap : In this parent node will always be less than or equal to the value of
child node.


###Applications of BinaryHeap:
1> Heap sort
2> Priority queue
